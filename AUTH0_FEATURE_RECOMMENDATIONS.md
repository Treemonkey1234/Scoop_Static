# Auth0 Feature Recommendations for Your Platform

This document provides tailored recommendations for leveraging Auth0 to enhance your social/event platform. Each feature includes an explanation of its value and guidance on implementation.

---

## 1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
**Why:** Protects user accounts from takeovers and builds trust, especially important for platforms with social interactions, reviews, and sensitive data (e.g., payments, trust scores).
**How:**
- Enable MFA for all users, or at least for admins/moderators and users with high trust scores or payment access.
- Use SMS, authenticator apps, or email as the second factor.

## 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Why:** Supports different user types (regular users, event organizers, moderators, admins) and restricts access to sensitive features.
**How:**
- Define roles in Auth0 (user, organizer, moderator, admin).
- Restrict access to moderation tools, analytics, or event management based on roles.
- Use Auth0's RBAC features to manage permissions.

## 3. Account Linking
**Why:** Prevents duplicate accounts and improves user experience by allowing users to link multiple social accounts or email/password to a single profile.
**How:**
- Enable account linking in Auth0.
- Allow users to link/unlink social accounts from their profile page.

## 4. Passwordless Authentication
**Why:** Reduces friction for users who don't want to remember passwords, especially for event attendees or casual users.
**How:**
- Enable email magic links or SMS one-time codes as a login option in Auth0.
- Offer alongside social logins for flexibility.

## 5. Progressive Profiling
**Why:** Improves onboarding by collecting more information as users engage, rather than all at once during signup.
**How:**
- Use Auth0's user metadata to store additional profile fields.
- Prompt for more info at key engagement points (e.g., after creating an event or posting a review).

## 6. Branded Universal Login
**Why:** Provides a consistent, professional login/signup experience that increases trust and conversion.
**How:**
- Customize Auth0's Universal Login to match your platform's branding, colors, and logo.
- Add custom fields or legal disclaimers as needed.

## 7. User Analytics & Security Monitoring
**Why:** Helps monitor for suspicious activity (e.g., spam reviews, brute-force attempts) and understand user engagement.
**How:**
- Use Auth0's built-in analytics and anomaly detection.
- Set up alerts for high-risk events (e.g., many failed logins, new device logins).

## 8. API Authorization with JWTs
**Why:** Secures your backend APIs (for events, reviews, payments) using Auth0-issued JWTs.
**How:**
- Require a valid Auth0 token for all API requests.
- Check user roles/permissions in your backend.

## 9. Custom User Metadata
**Why:** Allows you to store platform-specific data (e.g., trust score, event attendance, badges) directly in Auth0.
**How:**
- Use Auth0's user_metadata and app_metadata fields.
- Sync with your own database as needed.

## 10. Internationalization (i18n)
**Why:** Supports users from different countries with localized login/signup experiences.
**How:**
- Enable and configure supported languages in the Auth0 dashboard.
